## Roadmap

• We will promote the crap out of SNLP
• You could make some money out of it, or not
• When we finish this crazy ride, you’ll be able to exchange your SNLP tokens for Jaxx tokens. Or keep ‘em, or sell them.

Jaxx won’t be released until we get listing commitments for three centralised exchanges for a truly fair launch.

Jaxx will not be available on a dex unless a truly decentralised exchange comes into the picture ahead of launch.

The only way to get Jaxx tokens ahead of the launch is by holding SNLP tokens.
